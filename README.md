# Welcome to my Info Screen!

This is a project I've created based on [@aslakhol's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKWzQGUAClIi-j9IEs_3fp2b4zczHKk1d) info screen guide.
The screen displays information about the nearby bus stop's (live) timetables, as well as nearby available bikes. If you need a laugh to make your day, the top post from r/dadjokes is also shown ðŸ˜Ž

The project is not completed, and more components will be added soonâ„¢
